# United States Of America Computing Olympiad
Code written for my attempt of the United States of America Computing Olympiad, in Java. United States of America Computing Olympiad (USACO) is a national competitive programming competition where students all over the country are ranked in divisions for their solutions to various programming tasks. 

## Links to the specific questions
- [Problem 1](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=1086)
- [Problem 2](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=1087)
- [Problem 3](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=1088)

My solutions may not be the most efficient solutions out there, as Time Complexity within my programs have historically been neglected prior to the contest. Another note, I have no idea why USACO is overly obsessed with cows...
